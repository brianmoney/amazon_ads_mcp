"""Transform that enriches async API tools with polling hints.

Many Amazon Ads API operations are asynchronous — reports, exports, AMC
workflows, and audience jobs return an ID and require polling for completion.
This transform appends guidance to those tool descriptions so the LLM
communicates wait times to the user rather than spinning in a polling loop.
